## Libraries

* **FileFolders** <br />
A collection of methods to assist when trying to work with files and folders in PHP featuring:
    * *fileSize* <br />
    Depending on `path` parameter, returns either the **file** size on disk or calculates the entire **folder** size on disk and returns it
    * *duplicateFiles* <br />
    Counts files with the same name within the `path` parameter. Returns a number if `array` parameter is not set or is false, otherwise an array consisting of filenames and finding counts
    * *countFiles* <br />
    A simple file counter within a path (also counts files in sub-folders)
